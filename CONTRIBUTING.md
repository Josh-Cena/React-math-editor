So you decided to contribute to this project...

First of all, thank you so much! This is how we make open-source betterâ€”by not just being a user, but also a developer and a maintainer.

## For issue creators

For the time being, _any_ type of issue is welcomed. Questions, remarks, bug reports, confusions, feature requests... Please feel free to use the issues as the channel of interaction with me.

If I closed a bug/feature issue without linking any pull request, it doesn't mean that your idea is necessarily a bad one. You may want to discuss more with me about what you have in mind, and once I've acquired enough information, I may change my mind.

Before you create an issue, though, I kindly ask you to search through the issue history (including open and closed) to check that there hasn't been a similar one. This prevents wasting the time of us both.

## For pull request creators

I really appreciate and respect anyone's effort in trying to improve the code base, so I promise that I won't close any pull request without a good reason. The only case where I will close a pull request besides spamming is when I believe the implementation is completely going in the wrong direction, which is rare. If your pull request gets closed, I am still open to discussing how the feature can be better implemented, and another pull request is always welcomed.

Even the roughest pull request, if moving in the right direction, will be taken seriously. I will try my best to polish your code and make it compatible with the rest of the code base, and you will be credited as the main author when the PR is merged.

My timezone is UTC+0800 (Beijing time), so it may not always be the case that I can respond instantly, but I will usually check my inbox at least once every day. If you haven't received any feedback within 48 hours, feel free to reach out to me through email or other contacting methods.
