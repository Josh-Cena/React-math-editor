# Intro

It began in 10th grade when I first encountered MathJax. That was the time when I only knew Vue as a CDN script, but still, I made the first version of a [math editor](pathname:///legacy/)â€”in Vue, although Vue was only used to render the data and maintain the state. It was exactly like those webpages made in the 2000s with JQuery and Bootstrap, except here I hand-designed all the CSS (and honestly, I still think it looks nice). That was also my (proudly) first open-source "project", and [**it is not archived**](https://github.com/Josh-Cena/Web-math-editor) (although I don't have plans to maintain it either, just leave it as-is).

In two years' time I turned out to be an experienced developer now, so I decided to revisit this. With more experience in React currently, I think it's time to make a React real-time math editor as a reusable component.
